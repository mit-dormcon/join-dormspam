	<!-- copied from how to dormspam -->
	<p>Dormspam is the act of emailing the social lists of MIT dorms and the IFC, and is used for advertising events, club announcements, surveys, and more.</p>

	<strong>Pros</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Some dorms' dormspam lists also double as the intra-dorm communication, so you also get to hear
			about what is happening in your own dorm.</li>
		<li>Get to hear about events going on.</li>
		<li>Dormspam is great. TODO get the text to put here from Jordan and Ananda.</li>
	</ul>

	<strong>Cons</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>It is very spammy, but you can <a href="https://sites.mit.edu/how-to-dormspam/filter/" target="_blank">easily filter</a> it though.</li>
		<li>Sometimes there are flame wars.</li>
	</ul>
